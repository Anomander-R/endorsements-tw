            We don’t think you should upgrade just because Apple has released new phones.

            But if your current phone is running too slow or is damaged, or if you’re simply ready for an upgrade and you want a new phone now, we recommend the iPhone 13. It represents a relatively minor upgrade over 2020’s iPhone 12, but the improved cameras and better battery life build on the already great design and fast processing, with no drawbacks other than a few grams of added weight. If you prefer a smaller screen, the iPhone 13 mini is also a great choice, as it offers all the same features in an easier-to-hold package for $100 less.

          With Windows 11, Microsoft has taken a risk by changing up its operating system, though many of the changes amount to not much more than window dressing. Windows 11 is a response to competition from Apple and Google, both of which have been nibbling at the edges of the market-leading desktop operating system with slick new designs. Despite its drastically updated look intended to respond to the competition, Windows 11 functions much as Windows 10 does—with more polish and a few new features and conveniences.
